# Belly_Button

## Background:

A dashboard is to be created for the top 10 bacterial species found in the belly button. The dashboard is to toggle trough a list of individuals. With each individualthe information associated with them will be shown. One will also be able to see the distribution of bacteria cultures per sample. Finally, there will be a visual representation of how many time a week the individual whashes their belly button. 

## Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart

The horizontal bar chart is to be created using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js. Using a drop down menue on the webpage, the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) will be updated for an individual's ID.

## Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart

Bubble charts will be created when the dropdown menue webpage is updated for specific ID's.

*The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
*The sample_values as the y-axis values.
*The sample_values as the marker size.
*The otu_ids as the marker colors.
*The otu_labels as the hover-text values.
